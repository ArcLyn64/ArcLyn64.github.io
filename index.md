# Welcome to My Website!
Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a programmer by trade and a lot of other things by choice. If you're looking to hire me for one reason or another, feel free to take a look at my [résumé](/resume.html), the link is up in the banner. If you're not, then chances are you're here from seeing me on [YouTube]({{ site.youtube.link }}), in which case the [blog](/posts.html) section of this website is more likely to interest you.

I hope you enjoy your stay.
