I’d been visiting Round 1s to play DDR and assorted other games for a little while before this year, 
but my local arcade is far enough away that it was a biweekly trip at most - hardly enough to really improve. 
I, like, had DJMax in my steam library but without the novelty of the two washing machine games I loved (Wacca and Chrono Circle) it didn’t really hold that much appeal.

I have vivid/stasis to thank for turning me around on these. 
Besides having a kickass aesthetic, being illustrated by 57 who I’ve followed for years, and costing literally zero united states dollars, 
vivid/stasis is also the first rhythm game I played where I loved the vast majority of its soundtrack.

Usually when I played rhythm games at Round 1 I’d give up finding tracks I liked in favor of seeing which Touhou remixes were on any given machine, 
but in vivid/stasis I kind of just played all the tracks. 
By the time I’d reached the end of chapter 1, I think I’d played more tracks in just vivid/stasis than in every other rhythm game I’d played combined.

The chapter 1 finale is what I really have to thank vivid/stasis for, though. 
Until reaching it, the highest difficulty I’d finished a track on was 6, and I only really felt comfortable with 4s or 5s. 
But to continue with the (really good!) story, I’d have to beat a track that was difficulty 8! 
I think I grinded this track for a week - it helps that Pyromania is a banger. 
I think the journey to finish the finale was when rhythm games finally sunk their teeth all the way into me - or maybe it’s the other way around. 
Either way, the excitement I felt when I finally beat, and then later mastered, Pyromania’s easiest difficulty, was something I’d only ever felt after being fromsoft bosses. 

In fact, the more I played vivid/stasis - as well as DJMax, which I picked back up - the more I realized that rhythm games and action games have a surprising amount in common in terms of emotional beats. This might be more obvious looking at Sekiro, an action game that’s been often joked about being a rhythm game. 
Learning the ins-and-outs of a track, or boss, and using that knowledge to overcome it, as well as using the patterns you learned from that boss, or track, in the future to raise your abilities as a player is intoxicating - it’s the reason I play both genres. Besides the fact that I like cool fights and sick tunes, anyway.
