<p><em>And vivid/stasis is to blame.</em></p>
<h5 class="post-author"> By Lyn, <em>January 10th, 2025</em> </h5>
<p>I’d been visiting Round 1s to play DDR and assorted other games for a little while before this year,
but my local arcade is far enough away that it was a biweekly trip at most - hardly enough to really improve.
I, like, had DJMax in my steam library but without the novelty of the two washing machine games I loved (Wacca and Chrono Circle) it didn’t really hold that much appeal.</p>
<p>I have vivid/stasis to thank for turning me around on these.
Besides having a kickass aesthetic, being illustrated by 57 who I’ve followed for years, and costing literally zero united states dollars,
vivid/stasis is also the first rhythm game I played where I loved the vast majority of its soundtrack.</p>
<p>Usually when I played rhythm games at Round 1 I’d give up finding tracks I liked in favor of seeing which Touhou remixes were on any given machine,
but in vivid/stasis I kind of just played all the tracks.
By the time I’d reached the end of chapter 1, I think I’d played more tracks in just vivid/stasis than in every other rhythm game I’d played combined.</p>
<p>The chapter 1 finale is what I really have to thank vivid/stasis for, though.
Until reaching it, the highest difficulty I’d finished a track on was 6, and I only really felt comfortable with 4s or 5s.
But to continue with the (really good!) story, I’d have to beat a track that was difficulty 8!
I think I grinded this track for a week - it helps that Pyromania is a banger.
I think the journey to finish the finale was when rhythm games finally sunk their teeth all the way into me - or maybe it’s the other way around.
Either way, the excitement I felt when I finally beat, and then later mastered, Pyromania’s easiest difficulty, was something I’d only ever felt after being fromsoft bosses.</p>
<p>In fact, the more I played vivid/stasis - as well as DJMax, which I picked back up - the more I realized that rhythm games and action games have a surprising amount in common in terms of emotional beats. This might be more obvious looking at Sekiro, an action game that’s been often joked about being a rhythm game.
Learning the ins-and-outs of a track, or boss, and using that knowledge to overcome it, as well as using the patterns you learned from that boss, or track, in the future to raise your abilities as a player is intoxicating - it’s the reason I play both genres. Besides the fact that I like cool fights and sick tunes, anyway.</p>
